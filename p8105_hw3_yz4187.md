### Problem1

*The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write
a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):*

``` r
instacart = p8105.datasets::instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

data("instacart")
skimr::skim(instacart)
```

**Description:** This dataset named “instacart” contains 1384617 rows
and 15 columns. It contains 4 character variables and 11 numeric
variables. There are key variables such as “eval\_set”, “product\_name”,
“aisle”, “department”. Except these four variables, all other variables
are numeric.

#### Questions:

*Question: How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most
items ordered from?*

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ## # Groups:   aisle [134]
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

**Answer:** There are 134 aisles. “Fresh vegetables” are the most items
are order from .

*Question: Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each
aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered.
Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.*

``` r
instacart_plot = instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n >= 10000) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  mutate(aisle = forcats::fct_reorder(aisle, n))

  ggplot(instacart_plot, aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of Orders",
    caption = "Data from the Instacart Dataset"
  ) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

*Question: Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of
the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in
your table.*

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients","dog food care","packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n == max(n)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |

*Question: Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink
Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).*

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples","Coffee Ice Cream"))  %>%
  select(product_name, order_dow, order_hour_of_day) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>% 
  rename("Product Name" = "product_name", "Saturday" = "6", 
         "Sunday" = "0", "Monday" = "1", "Tuesday" = "2", 
         "Wednesday" = "3", "Thursday" = "4", "Friday" = "5") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Product Name     |   Sunday |   Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday |
|:-----------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 |  15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 |  14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |
